#Programming a Nao robot to be able to perform the role of a forward soccer/football player. For the behaviour programming of these robots, Python was used as well as work the programme Webots for simulation and the programme Choregraphe for making the perfect kick. The Nao is able to detect the ball in the field, approach and align with the ball, detect the goal and align with it and finally, kick the ball into the goal
