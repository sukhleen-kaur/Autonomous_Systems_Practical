The Python source root directory.

*** Running Code ***

From here, you should run things like:

- The brain, e.d.:
# python brain.py config/my_config

- The communicator (one on each system) if you use one or more vision modules,
e.d.:
# python communicator/communicator.py

- The motion controller (if you use the pioneer), e.d.:
# python pioneercontrol/pioneercontroller/motionController 12345

*** Important Directories ***

- config: Here the main configuration files are located. Normally we have one 
configuration file per test.

- vision: Here all vision modules are located (can also be other recognition 
modules that are actually not vision based, e.d. laser navigation etc.)

- behavior: Here all behaviors are located.
New behaviors are created only after running the generate behavior script, e.d.:
# python basebehavior/generate_behaviors.py

- speech: Grammer and XML config files for speech recognition.
See speech/client/grammer/ for example grammer files (first make sure to verify 
that the grammar file is correctly set in the XML file that you specified in 
the main config file of your project (e.d. in ./config)).

- body: Bodycontroller, extend with new functionality if you use new hardware.
