## BinarySocket class                                                         ##
################################################################################
The BinarySocket is an instance of the IOWrapper for IOManager, to handle
network connections in an asynchronous manner.                             

It uses the ThreadedSocket class to handle the IO related functionality of the
class.

The purpose of the BinarySocket class is to send binary data over a socket.
The pickle class can be used for this theoretically, but with large amounts of
data this is not efficient as pickling takes a lot of time. Each piece of binary
data can be accompanied by a piece of metadata. The metadata should be
relatively small as it will be pickled before being transported. The binary
string can be of any length. If you want, you can use the BinarySocket as a
replacement for threadedsocket as you can simply omit the binary data and just
send metadata; yielding more or less the same results, but this is not
recommended.

The BinarySocket works rather simply by prepending a 9-byte header before each
request. The first 4 bytes represent an unsigned integer giving the amount of
bytes of metadata in the current request, the next 4 bytes represent an unsigned
integer giving the amount of bytes of binary data in the current request. The
last byte represents a boolean indicating whether the data has been compressed.
The size of the metadata is calculated after pickling the metadata and optional
compression. The size of the binary data is calculated after optional
compression.

When receiving data, the header will be read. Afterwards, the specified amount
of bytes is read as metadata and the data is unpickled, and next, the specified
amount of bytes of binary data is read. When the entire request has been
received, the metadata and binary data is appended to the receive buffer and can
be obtained normally, as if you were retrieving data from the ThreadedSocket:

data = binarysocket.get_data()

Here, data will be a list containing the received data. Each element will be a
tuple (metadata, binary_data). You can then use the metadata to recreate
whatever the binary data representes. For example, you can store the depth,
number of channels and the dimensions of an opencv image in the metadata and use
the image.tostring() method to generate the binary data. This way, you can
transport images over the socket easily. This also works for, for example, large
numpy arrays, sound streams or other large data.

The BinarySocket class is designed to be used over Unix Domain Sockets, TCP
sockets connecting to a local host or to a Local Area Network. It was not
designed to be used over a more unstable connection such as the internet. It
therefore does not split the data, use checksums or have means to refetch
incorrectly transferred parts, making the protocol more efficient over stable
connections. To transfer over the internet, more elaborate protocols are
required.
