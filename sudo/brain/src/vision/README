This directory contains all vision modules (or any other recognition modules).

If you like to add your own module, make sure to:
- To write proper unittests and add it to the testrunner.
- Write proper documentation that people can use to run the module.
- Write a simple example behavior.
- To *not* add huge datasets to the repo (use the online data directory of the BORG).
- To *not* add any compiled or binary files (except for small images).
